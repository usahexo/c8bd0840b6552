Spurs fans everywhere are celebrating their team’s latest victory. The San Antonio Spurs completed a 4-0 sweep of the Miami Heat in the NBA Finals, cementing their place as one of the greatest teams in NBA history.</p>
<p>Tony Parker was named MVP of the Finals, after averaging 17 points and 5 assists per game. Tim Duncan was also named Finals MVP in 2007, when the Spurs defeated LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers.</p>
<p>The Spurs have now won five championships since 1999, which is more than any other team in the NBA over that period. Coach Gregg Popovich deserves a lot of credit for leading this team to victory year after year. He has created a culture of winning in San Antonio, and his players never give up when things get tough.</p>
<p>The Miami Heat were no match for the Spurs this year, as San Antonio dominated from start to finish. The Heat simply didn’t have an answer for Kawhi Leonard, who averaged 22 points and 10 rebounds per game in the Finals. Leonard is quickly becoming one of the best players in the league, and he will be a major factor in future Spurs championship runs.</p>
<p>The San Antonio Spurs are now unquestionably the best team in basketball, and there is nobody else who can rival them right now. Gregg Popovich has created a dynasty in San Antonio, and it doesn’t look like anybody is going to stop them anytime soon. Congratulations to the San Antonio Spurs on being crowned NBA champions once again!</p>
<h1 id="When-Did-Casino-Gambling-Come-to-Arkansas"><a href="#When-Did-Casino-Gambling-Come-to-Arkansas" class="headerlink" title="When Did Casino Gambling Come to Arkansas?"></a>When Did Casino Gambling Come to Arkansas?</h1><p>Arkansas is one of the less well-known states in the US with regards to casino gambling. As a matter of fact, when did casino gambling come to Arkansas? This guide provides an answer to this question and also looks at what casinos are currently present in the state.</p>
<p>The first casino in Arkansas was the Diamond Jo Worth Casino which launched in December of 2014. Prior to this, there were no legal casinos in the state and it was only through amendments to the state’s constitution that casino gambling was allowed.</p>
<p>There are currently three casinos operating in Arkansas – two of which are tribal casinos owned by the Cherokee Nation and the Quapaw Tribe. The third is the Diamond Jo Worth Casino which is located in North Little Rock.</p>
<p>As far as gambling options go, players can enjoy slot machines, table games, and poker at all three of Arkansas’s casinos. However, only the Diamond Jo Worth Casino offers a full range of gaming options, including keno, bingo, and a sportsbook.</p>
<p>So, when did casino gambling come to Arkansas? In short, it came in December of 2014 with the launch of the Diamond Jo Worth Casino. This makes Arkansas one of the newer states when it comes to casino gambling, so those looking for a more established gambling scene may want to look elsewhere.</p>
<h1 id="San-Antonio-Spurs-Win-the-NBA-Finals-in-5-Games"><a href="#San-Antonio-Spurs-Win-the-NBA-Finals-in-5-Games" class="headerlink" title="San Antonio Spurs Win the NBA Finals in 5 Games"></a>San Antonio Spurs Win the NBA Finals in 5 Games</h1><p>The San Antonio Spurs were the best team in the NBA all season long and they proved it by winning the NBA Finals in 5 games. The Spurs had an incredible offense that was led by superstar forward Kawhi Leonard, who averaged 27.5 points per game in the playoffs. They also had a great defense that ranked first in the league in efficiency.</p>
<p>The Golden State Warriors were a very good team, but they were no match for the Spurs. The Warriors had no answer for Leonard and the Spurs’ other stars, Tim Duncan and Tony Parker. The Warriors also had no answer for the Spurs’ defense, which held them to just 95 points per game in the series.</p>
<p>In the end, the Spurs were just too good for the Warriors and they deserved to win the NBA Finals. Congratulations to the Spurs on an amazing season and an even more amazing championship!</p>
<h1 id="When-Did-Casino-Gambling-Come-to-Arkansas-Spurs-Win-it-All"><a href="#When-Did-Casino-Gambling-Come-to-Arkansas-Spurs-Win-it-All" class="headerlink" title="When Did Casino Gambling Come to Arkansas? Spurs Win it All!"></a>When Did Casino Gambling Come to Arkansas? Spurs Win it All!</h1><p>Arkansas is one of the states in the US that doesn’t have casino gambling. It’s unclear when exactly the state banned it, but it seems to have been sometime in the early 1900s. The 1920 Arkansas Constitution prohibited all forms of gambling, and this has apparently been carried over into subsequent constitutions.</p>
<p>There have been a few attempts over the years to overturn the ban on casino gambling in Arkansas, but they have all failed. In 2003, a proposal to allow limited casino gambling was voted down by 75% of voters. And in 2012, a proposal to allow full-scale casinos was also voted down by a wide margin.</p>
<p>So why is Arkansas so opposed to casino gambling? There are probably a few reasons. First, there’s the religious factor. Arkansans are largely conservative and religious, and many people see gambling as being morally wrong. Additionally, there are concerns that casinos would lead to crime and social ills, and that they would take money away from local businesses.</p>
<p>Interestingly, though, there is one form of casino gambling that is legal in Arkansas – bingo! This goes back to the early days of prohibition, when bingo was seen as a game of skill rather than chance. Today, there are dozens of bingo halls throughout the state, and they’re quite popular.</p>
<p>So will Arkansas ever change its stance on casino gambling? It’s hard to say. The issue has come up several times over the past few years, but it doesn’t seem likely that it will be legalized anytime soon.</p>
<h1 id="Tim-Duncan-Announces-Retirement-After-Win"><a href="#Tim-Duncan-Announces-Retirement-After-Win" class="headerlink" title="Tim Duncan Announces Retirement After Win"></a>Tim Duncan Announces Retirement After Win</h1><p>In a move that surprised few, San Antonio Spurs forward Tim Duncan today announced his retirement from the NBA after a 19-year career. The five-time champion, two-time MVP and 15-time All-Star is one of the most accomplished players in league history, but said this season – his 19th – would be his last.</p>
<p>“It’s been an amazing journey,” Duncan said in a statement released by the Spurs. “I’m grateful to have been part of the NBA community for so long.”</p>
<p>Duncan spent his entire career with the Spurs, making him one of just four players to do so. He was the No. 1 overall pick in the 1997 draft, and helped turn the small-market Spurs into a perennial championship contender. In addition to his five titles, Duncan also won two MVP Awards and was named to the All-NBA first team 10 times.</p>
<p>“Tim Duncan is one of the most iconic players in NBA history and arguably the best power forward ever,” NBA commissioner Adam Silver said in a statement. “His sustained excellence and ELEVEN championships are unparalleled.”</p>
<p>The 2016-17 season was one of tumult for Duncan and the Spurs. After 19 seasons of stability under coach Gregg Popovich, San Antonio experienced its first roster overhaul in recent memory, with longtime stalwarts such as Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili departing. The aging Spurs also struggled on the court, missing the playoffs for the first time since 1997.</p>
<p>The 40-year old Duncan had hinted at retirement before, but this appears to be final decision. In his statement, he cited “the desire to make sure that I am leaving everything out there on the court” as one of his reasons for retiring now.</p>
<p>In a career full of great moments, perhaps none was greater than when Duncan led the Spurs to a victory over LeBron James and the Miami Heat in 2013 for their fifth title. With that win, Duncan joined Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant as the only players to win five titles and two MVP Awards.</p>
<p>After announcing his retirement today, Duncan posted a letter on The Players’ Tribune website thanking fans for their support over the years.</p>
<p>“For me it’s always been about winning,” Duncan wrote in conclusion. “And I can’t think of anything else I’d rather do than go out on top.”</p>
