This guide will teach you the basics of the game, as well as some tips and tricks to help you come out on top.</p>
<p>The goal of blackjack is to achieve a hand value that is as close to 21 as possible, without going over. The first decision you’ll need to make is how many cards to take - typically, it’s best to take between one and three cards. Keep in mind that the fewer cards you take, the more likely it is that you’ll bust (go over 21).</p>
<p>Once you’ve decided how many cards to take, it’s time to start playing. The dealer will deal two cards face up to each player, and one card face up to themselves. The player’s goal is to beat the dealer’s hand - either by getting a higher hand value than the dealer, or by forcing the dealer to bust.</p>
<p>In order to do this, players can either hit (take another card) or stand (end their turn). In most cases, it’s best to hit if your hand value is below 17, and stand if your hand value is 17 or above. However, there are a few other things you should keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If your hand value is below 10, always hit - otherwise, you’re likely to bust.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If the dealer’s face-up card is an Ace, they might have a blackjack (an Ace and a 10), in which case all players except for the one with the blackjack lose automatically. In order not to lose automatically in this situation, you can choose to “insure” your bet against the dealer having a blackjack - this costs half of your original bet amount, but ensures that you’ll receive half your bet back even if the dealer does have a blackjack.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If both of the dealer’s cards are equal (e.g. two 2s), they must hit - even if their hand value exceeds 21.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After both players have had their turn, the dealer will reveal their hidden card and compare both hands. If the player’s hand value is greater than or equal to the dealer’s hand value, they win; otherwise, they lose.</p>

Not only can you win without having to pay taxes, but the casino also pays out 3-2 on blackjacks. This means that for every $10 wagered, the casino pays out $12.50.</p>
<p>Blackjack is a game that is played between a player and a dealer. The player is dealt two cards, and the dealer is dealt two cards, one face up and one face down. The goal of the game is to get closer to 21 than the dealer without going over. Face cards are worth 10 points, an ace can be worth either 1 or 11 points, and all other cards are worth their number value.</p>
<p>If you have a total of 21 points with your first two cards (either an ace and a ten, or two picture cards), you have a blackjack and automatically win the hand. If you go over 21 points, you bust and lose automatically.</p>
<p>If your total is closer to 21 than the dealer’s total, you win the hand. If the dealers total is closer to 21 than your total, you lose the hand. In both cases, the dealer must hit until they reach 17 or higher points total; at which point they must stand no matter what their current total is.</p>
<p>In Pennsylvania casinos, if you are dealt blackjack on your first two cards, you will automatically win unless the dealer has blackjack as well. In this case, it is a tie and both players get their money back. This payout of 3-2 on blackjack makes Pennsylvania casinos one of the most lucrative places to play this game in the country.</p>

With its origins dating back to the 17th century, it has been enjoyed by players of all ages and skill levels. Whether youre a beginner or a seasoned pro, you can always benefit from learning new tips and strategies for playing casino blackjack. In this article, well cover some essential techniques that will help you win at Pottawatomi and keep your money!</p>
<p>First and foremost, youll want to make sure youre familiar with the basic rules of blackjack. This game is played with a deck of 52 cards, and the aim is to beat the dealers hand by either reaching 21 or getting as close to 21 as possible without going bust. You can also win by having a higher total than the dealer, regardless of whether or not your hand contains 21. In addition to this, blackjack also offers several side bets which can be quite lucrative if you know what youre doing.</p>
<p>Once you have a good understanding of the basics, its time start learning some advanced strategies. One of the most important things to remember is that blackjack is a game of odds and probability. This means that you shouldnt take risks unless the potential payout is worth it. For instance, if the dealers upcard is an Ace, hes likely to have a Blackjack (an Ace + any other card). In this situation, its usually smart to stand rather than risk going bust.</p>
<p>Another key thing to remember is that dealer must hit on 16 or less and must stand on 17 or more. As such, If the dealers upcard is a 2-6, youll want to hit whenever your hand totals 12 or less. Conversely, if the dealers upcard is 7-Ace, youll want to stand on all 17s and 18s. These are just a few examples; for a more comprehensive guide, be sure to consult one of our many blackjack strategy charts!</p>
<p>Finally, here are a few additional tips that will help improve your chances of winning at Pottawatomi:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Be aware of the different types of blackjack hands: pair, two pair, three of a kind etc. This will help you make better decisions when it comes time to hit or stand.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Dont forget about splitting pairs! If you have two cards of equal value (e.g. two eights), then you can split them into two separate hands by placing another bet equal to the original wager. This greatly increases your chances of winning multiple hands in a row!</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use bankroll management techniques to keep your losses under control. In short, never bet more than you can afford to lose!</p>
</li>
