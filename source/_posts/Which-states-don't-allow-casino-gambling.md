#  Which states don't allow lotteries?

The U.S. states of Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia and Hawaii do not allow state-run lotteries. Nevada allows charitable lotteries but not state-operated ones.

Maryland also bans state-run lottery games but allows three commercial games held by the Multi-State Lottery Association: Powerball, Mega Millions and Hot Lotto. The District of Columbia operates its own lottery.

Hawaii is the only state in the country that completely bans all types of gambling, including lotteries.

#  Which states don't allow sports betting?

There are a total of six states in America that do not allow any form of sports betting. These states are Delaware, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Montana, and South Dakota.

Each of these states has its own reasoning for why it does not allow sports betting. Some state officials say that it could create corruption within the government or that it would be hard to regulate. Others say that they simply don't believe that sports betting is a good idea.

Interestingly, five of the six states that do not allow sports betting also have laws against casino gambling. This seems to suggest that these states are more interested in keeping out any form of gambling than they are in allowing people to bet on sports.

It will be interesting to see if any of these states change their stance on sports betting in the coming years. With more and more states legalizing it, the pressure is on for those that have yet to do so.

#  Which states don't allow online gambling?

Under the Federal Wire Act, only certain states are allowed to offer gambling services. The states that are allowed to offer gambling services are Delaware, Nevada, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. Currently, there are no other states that allow gambling services besides these four.

This is largely due to the fact that online gambling is technically illegal under federal law. However, there have been talks of changing this law in the near future. If this were to happen, it would open up the door for many more states to start offering gambling services online.

For now, however, those living in any other state will not be able to participate in any form of online gambling. This includes casino games, poker tournaments, and sports betting.
