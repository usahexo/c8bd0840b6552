#  Hornets make playoffs for 1st time in 3 years;Implication? 

The Charlotte Hornets clinched their spot in the playoffs for the first time in three years on Friday night, defeating the Brooklyn Nets 109-98. This was also the Hornetsâ€™ first win at Barclays Center this season.

Thoughts on what this means for the Hornets organization? 

Some observers are touting this accomplishment as a sign that the Hornets are finally headed in the right direction and becoming a playoff caliber team. Given that they have made it to the playoffs, albeit as an 8th seed, it could be said that they have surpassed expectations. However, others caution that this may only be a fluke and that they could easily regress next season.

What are your thoughts? 

I believe that making the playoffs is a good sign for the Hornets organization. It indicates that they are trending in the right direction and growing as a team. However, I also think it is important not to get too carried away with this accomplishment. They still have much work to do in order to become a true playoff contender.

#  NBA Playoffs: Hornets take Game 1 from Miami Heat; Implication?

The Charlotte Hornets pulled off an improbable upset in game one of the playoffs against the Miami Heat. The Heat are a historically good team and were heavily favored to win the series, but the Hornets managed to take them down 92-88.

What does this mean for the rest of the playoffs?

Well, it's certainly possible that this upset could be a sign of things to come. The Hornets are a young and up-and-coming team, while the Heat are aging and starting to decline. If Charlotte can continue to play well, they could easily make it all the way to the Finals.

On the other hand, it's also possible that this was just a fluke and that Miami will come back firing in game two. They're still a very talented team, and they have plenty of playoff experience. It's going to be tough for Charlotte to pull off another upset against them.

Only time will tell which team is going to come out on top in this series. One thing is for sure though: it's going to be exciting to watch!

#  Clifford: playoff berth a 'huge step forward' for Hornets;Implication?

The Charlotte Hornets clinched a playoff berth on Saturday night with a 111-105 victory over the Detroit Pistons, and head coach Steve Clifford was understandably excited.

"It's a huge step forward," Clifford said after the game, per Rick Bonnell of The Charlotte Observer. "It's something our guys have worked for all year. They've deserved it."

This will be just the second time in franchise history that the Hornets have made the playoffs, and it's clear that Clifford believes this team is capable of doing some damage.

"We've got good balance and we've played well against good teams," Clifford said. "Now we've got to do it in the playoffs."

There are certainly some intriguing matchups awaiting the Hornets in the first round, including a potential meeting with the Miami Heat or Toronto Raptors. Charlotte went 3-1 against Miami this season and 2-1 against Toronto, so they'll be confident heading into any series against either team.

Of course, there are no guarantees in the NBA playoffs, but the Hornets appear to be a team on the rise under Clifford. This playoff berth is a big step forward for them, and it could lead to even bigger things in the years to come.

#  Charlotte Hornets Betting Odds - NBA Playoffs Implied Probability

The Charlotte Hornets have entered the NBA playoffs as underdogs to the Miami Heat. The Hornets are currently +650 on the odds to win the series, while the Heat are -1200 favorites.

Miami has been a strong team all season, finishing in 3rd place in the Eastern Conference with a record of 44-38. Charlotte, meanwhile, finished in 7th place with a record of 36-46. The Heat did beat the Hornets in all 4 meetings during the regular season.

However, this is playoff basketball and anything can happen. The Hornets will need to play their best basketball if they want to upset the favored Heat.

 Kemba Walker is the key to Charlotte's success. He averaged 23.2 points and 5.5 assists per game during the regular season, and will need to continue performing at a high level if the Hornets want to win. Nicolas Batum will also need to step up his game, as he averaged 14.9 points and 6.1 rebounds per game this season.

Miami is led by Goran Dragic, who averaged 20 points and 6 assists per game during the regular season. Hassan Whiteside is also a key player for Miami, averaging 14 points and 11 rebounds per game this year. Dragic and Whiteside will need to continue playing at a high level if Miami wants to advance past Charlotte.

#  Hornets could upset Wizards in first round of playoffs

The Washington Wizards could be in for a surprise in the first round of the playoffs, as they may face off against the Charlotte Hornets. The Hornets have been one of the most improved teams in the NBA this season, and they could give the Wizards a tough matchup.

The Hornets have a deep roster, with players like Kemba Walker and Nicolas Batum leading the way. They also have a solid bench, which could be crucial in a seven-game series. The Wizards, on the other hand, are led by John Wall and Bradley Beal. While they are a very talented duo, they may not be enough to take down the Hornets.

The Hornets also have playoff experience, which could be an advantage for them. The Wizards have only made it to the playoffs once in the last six years. If the Hornets can keep up their high level of play, they could pull off an upset and advance to the next round.
