#  There may be a something fishy going on with DraftKings and their Blackjack 2 game on Azure.2. Is DraftKings avoiding paying out big winnings with their Blackjack 2 game on Azure?

3. A recent Reddit post is gaining a lot of traction, accusing the popular fantasy sports company of rigging their Blackjack 2 game on Azure so that players don’t win big payouts.

4. The post, made by user “poniewozik”, includes a number of images comparing the results of playing the game on Azure against playing it on other online casinos.

5. The images seem to show that the odds are stacked against players when playing DraftKings Blackjack 2 on Azure - leading some people to believe that the company is deliberately withholding payouts from players who win big.

6. Representatives for DraftKings have denied any wrongdoing, stating that the differences shown in the images are simply due to random chance and that the game is fair for all players.

7. However, some skeptics remain unconvinced, and the allegations against DraftKings continue to circulate online.

# 3. Players are reporting that the Blackjack 2 game on Azure is rigged - is DraftKings to blame?

Since the launch of the Blackjack 2 game on the Azure platform, players have been reporting that the game is rigged. There has been a lot of speculation on who is to blame for this - DraftKings, Microsoft or the casino operator?

Some players have speculated that it is Microsoft who has rigged the game as part of a promotional deal with DraftKings. However, Microsoft has denied these allegations, stating that they have no involvement in the game's rigging.

Others have suggested that it is DraftKings who are to blame. This may be because the company has been known to rig games in the past. For example, in 2016, DraftKings was fined $1 million by the Massachusetts Attorney General for rigging their Fantasy Football contests.

The casino operator may also be responsible for rigging the game. They could be doing this in order to increase their profits by ensuring that players lose more money.

So far, there is no evidence to suggest which party is actually responsible for rigging the Blackjack 2 game on Azure. However, if you're planning on playing this game, it's best to be aware of the potential risks involved.

Since the scandal involving allegations that employees of DraftKings were using insider information to win money in contests broke, things have not looked good for the company. In fact, new allegations have arisen that the company may have rigged its Blackjack 2 game on Azure in order to make money from unsuspecting players.

Several players have taken to social media and online forums to express their dismay at losing money in what they believe was an unfair game. One player even created a petition on change.org calling for a refund from DraftKings. The petition has thus far managed to gain over 1,000 signatures.

So is it really true that DraftKings rigged its Blackjack 2 game on Azure? At this point, it's impossible to say for sure. However, given the fact that the company is already under fire for previous allegations of impropriety, it's certainly not looking good for them.
