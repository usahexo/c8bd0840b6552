#  No Pair in Sight During Triple Draw Poker Action

The game of Triple Draw Poker is one that can be very lucrative for those that are able to take down a pot. With three rounds of betting, and the ability to see every other player's hand, there are plenty of opportunities for players to make a big score. However, on a recent night at the casino, no player was able to take down a pot, much to the disappointment of those in attendance.

The night got off to a slow start, with only a few small pots being won. The action really started heating up near the end of the second hour, as players began to get more aggressive. However, even with all the action taking place, nobody was able to win a pot worth more than $200.

Players were getting all of their money in on the river, but nobody was able to hit their card combination good enough to claim the pot. One player even had quad deuces, but was unable to win when another player managed to hit a full house. In the end, all of the players left the table disappointed, knowing that they had missed out on some potential profits.

It will be interesting to see if this type of action continues in future games at the casino. With so many talented players at the table, it's no surprise that nobody was able to come away with a winning hand. It will be interesting to see if anyone can break through and take down a big pot in future games.

#  No Kings or Aces Seen at the Tables

It’s 9pm on a Thursday night and all of the tables in the casino are occupied. You take a seat at the blackjack table, where you are greeted by the dealer. The table is lively, with people chatting and laughing amongst themselves. The cards are dealt and the game begins.

You quickly lose focus as you listen to the conversations around you. It seems that everyone is winning, except for you. You manage to get up from the table after losing your last $20. As you walk away from the table, you can’t help but notice the disappointing look on your friend’s face as she watches you leave.

If only you had known that there was a cheater at the table…

This may sound like something out of a movie, but believe it or not, this does happen occasionally in casinos across North America. In fact, according to an article on blackjackchamp.com, cheating at blackjack is one of the most common forms of casino fraud. This can include everything from card counting to collusion between players.

So how can you protect yourself against cheaters when playing blackjack? The first step is to be aware of what they might do in order to cheat. Some of the most common methods include: dealing cards from the bottom of the deck, switching cards during play, hiding cards up their sleeves, and marking cards with invisible ink.

If you suspect that someone is cheating at your table, alert casino security immediately. They will be able to investigate and take appropriate action. In some cases, this may mean asking that player to leave the casino premises.

While it’s unfortunate that cheaters exist, there are ways to protect yourself against them. Be aware of what they might do and keep a close eye on your cards and those of your opponents. If something doesn’t seem right, don’t hesitate to alert security so they can investigate further.

#  No Straights or Flushes Being Drawn

In a game of poker, if there are no straights or flushes being drawn, then the odds of any particular card being called are 1 in 52. This is because there are 52 cards in a deck, and only one of those is the card that is being called. If there are two remaining players in the hand, then the odds of the called card appearing are 1 in 26.

#  Players Searching for Better Hands to Win with

In today’s poker world, there are immense talents and strategies being brought to the table by both amateur and professional players. But even with the odds seemingly in their favour, some players are still on the lookout for an edge. With this, they search for better hands to play so as to increase their chances of winning.

While Texas Hold’em is a relatively straightforward game, it can be complexed by the different variants and betting rounds. This means that move selection is key, and choosing the right hand to play is essential in order to come out on top.

Players will often sit back and wait until they have a strong hand before acting, but this can also lead to them folding too often or not taking advantage of good opportunities. It’s important to remember that not all hands are created equal – there are some weak hands that should be folded preflop, while there are other powerhouse hands that warrant a raise.

When deciding which hand to play, it’s helpful to keep in mind the five basic poker hand rankings:

Pair
Two Pair
Three of a Kind
Straight
Flush
Royal Flush 



  In general, the higher up on this list a hand ranks, the stronger it is. But as with all things poker-related, there are exceptions to every rule. For example, two pair may beat a singleton (One Pair), but three of a kind will always trump two pair. And while a flush is generally better than a straight, if one of the hands is Aces full then the Full House will win.     As we can see, there are many different factors that need to be taken into account when playing Texas Hold’em. But with practice and perseverance, players can give themselves the best chance possible of winning by using better hands more often.

#  Lots of Low Cards in Play as Players Hope to Improved Their Hands

With the first of four $1,000 NLHE events in the books, 811 players took their seats on Day 1a with the goal of advancing to Day 2. After ten levels of play, just 176 players remained, and only 68 will bag chips at the end of the night.

Given the relatively low buy-in for this tournament, it's not surprising to see so many players still in contention. As always, however, only a select few will make it to the money and ultimately compete for the title.

Right now, anyone with a manageable stack is feeling good about their chances. But there are still plenty of low cards in play, so those who are short-stacked need to be careful not to get caught in a bind.

In Level 10, Blinds were 400/800 with a 100 ante, and there was plenty of action throughout the day. Among those who fell victim to short-stacking were Griffin Benger (176th - $1,008), Curt Kohles (160th - $1,088), and Tuan Le (153rd - $1,144).

On the other hand, some big names managed to bag healthy stacks heading into Day 2. These include bracelet winners John Monnette (202nd - $864), Benny Glaser (158th - $992), and Rep Porter (147th - $1,152).

Others who will be returning on Saturday include Phil Hellmuth (122nd - $960), Antonio Esfandiari (118th - $976), and Daniel Negreanu (82nd -$1,248).

With so much money on the line over these next two days, anything can happen. Be sure to stay tuned as we bring you all the exciting updates from this event!
