#  OM Strikes Gold in Sports Betting World

Online sports betting has exploded in popularity in the past decade. Bettors can now place wagers on sporting events from the comfort of their own homes, with hundreds of betting options available for each game. This has been a boon for the gambling industry, as well as for fans of sports betting.

One company that has found success in the online sports betting world is OM. OM is a Maltese company that was founded in 2014. The company offers a wide range of betting options for its customers, including traditional wagers such as point spreads and totals, as well as props and futures bets.

In addition to its expansive offering of bets, OM also stands out from the competition due to its customer service. The company's customer service team is dedicated to helping customers with any questions or problems they may have. This high level of customer service has helped OM become one of the most popular online sports betting platforms in the world.

OM also offers a variety of bonuses and promotions to its customers. These bonuses help players increase their bankrolls and give them a better chance to win money on their bets. In addition, OM offers a VIP program that rewards its loyal customers with special perks and benefits.

One thing that makes OM stand out from the competition is the fact that it accepts Bitcoin as a payment method. Bitcoin is a digital currency that allows users to make transactions anonymously and securely. This makes it a perfect payment method for online gambling platforms such as OM.

Since its founding, OM has become one of the most successful online sports betting platforms in the world. The company offers its customers a wide range of betting options, excellent customer service, and dozens of bonuses and promotions. In addition, OM accepts Bitcoin as a payment method, making it one of the most convenient platforms for bettors around the globe.

#  Marseille the Big Betting Favorites Heading into the New Season

The French Ligue 1 is back and so too are the big betting favorites. Marseille, as defending champions, come into this new season as the team to beat. They’re expected by many to make a serious title challenge and they’ve been installed as the bookmakers’ favorite ahead of the likes of PSG and Monaco.

There’s no doubt that Marseille have made some impressive signings this summer. The arrivals of Dimitri Payet, Luiz Gustavo and Steven Fletcher have all strengthened their squad considerably. They already had a very talented squad but these new additions have taken them up another notch.

Payet is a particular standout player. He was one of the stars of Euro 2016 and his skills will be sure to light up Ligue 1 this season. He should be able to help Marseille push on and achieve even more success.

They may not have managed to win any silverware last season but they were still very impressive, losing out only on the final day of the season in a closely-fought title race. This year, they’ll be looking to go one better and clinch the championship trophy.

PSG and Monaco will undoubtedly provide stiff competition but if Marseille can continue playing at their best then they should be able to come out on top. It should be an exciting season ahead for fans of French football!

#  OM Opens as 3rd Most Popular Sports Betting Club in France

The Paris-based OM (Olympique de Marseille) has become the country's third most popular sports betting club, according to a new study by the French gaming regulator ARJEL.

The research shows that OM now has a market share of 4.5%, surpassing traditional giants such as Olympique Lyonnais (4.2%) and Stade Rennais (3.9%). The top spot is still held by Paris Saint-Germain (15.8%), while Ligue 1 rivals Monaco (7.1%) and Nice (6.7%) complete the top four.

ARJEL's report indicates that OM has seen its market share increase steadily over the last two years, largely thanks to the success of superstar striker Dimitri Payet. The 29-year-old was instrumental in Les Phocéens' run to the Europa League final in 2017, scoring nine goals and registering six assists en route to the showpiece event.

OM's growing popularity as a betting destination is also reflected in its online presence. The club currently ranks seventh among France's top 20 websites for sports betting, with annual revenue of €4 million (£3.5 million/$4.6 million). This is up from 15th place in 2016, when it generated just €1 million in revenue from bets placed online.

"This growth confirms OM's attractiveness as a sports betting destination," said representative Frédéric Thiriez. "It testifies to the great passion for football that exists in Marseille and throughout France."

#  French Giants Continue Prime Position in Sports Betting Race 

France has always been a powerhouse in the sports betting world, and that shows no signs of changing any time soon. The top French teams continue to lead the pack in European sports betting, with football (soccer), rugby, and cycling leading the way.

One of the most notable aspects of French betting is its focus on international matches. While American bettors are often drawn to domestic contests, the French prefer to put their money on matchups between top-level teams from all over the world. This global perspective gives them a distinct edge over other betting markets.

The top French football clubs have always been among the most successful in Europe, and that has translated into big profits for bettors. Paris Saint-Germain and Olympique Lyonnais have consistently ranked among the continent’s best teams, and they offer great value for bettors looking to make a smart investment.

Rugby is another sport where France excels at the international level. The national team has consistently been one of the best in Europe, and they offer great odds for those looking to place a wager. In recent years, they have even started to compete with rugby powerhouses like Australia and New Zealand.

While cycling may not be as popular as football or rugby in France, it is still a major part of the sports betting scene. The Tour de France is one of the most prestigious cycling events in the world, and it regularly attracts some of the biggest names in the sport. Bettors can find excellent value by placing bets on this event each year.

#  Marseille Ahead of Paris Saint-Germain in French Sports Betting Market

The second most populous city in France, Marseille, is enjoying a resurgence on and off the pitch. The team is currently third in the Ligue 1 table, behind only perennial powerhouses Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) and Monaco. However, Marseille is ahead of PSG in terms of sports betting odds at some online bookmakers.

This could be due to a number of reasons. First, Marseille has been more active in the transfer market than PSG this summer. The arrivals of Dimitri Payet, Luiz Gustavo and Valere Germain have given the club a major boost. Meanwhile, PSG’s only high-profile signing was Neymar for a world-record fee.

Marseille has also been more successful in recent years. The club reached the UEFA Europa League final in 2010 and won the tournament two years later. In contrast, PSG have never won a major European trophy.

Finally, PSG are facing instability off the pitch. Manager Unai Emery was recently replaced by Thomas Tuchel, while chairman Nasser Al-Khelaifi is being investigated by French authorities over corruption allegations. This may have caused some bettors to shy away from backing the Parisian club.

Whatever the reason, Marseille is currently ahead of PSG in the French sports betting market at several online bookmakers. This could provide some good value for those looking to back Rudi Garcia’s side this season.
