different things, but are often confused. Crude oil is the name given to a \"raw\" form of petroleum that has not been refined. Petroleum is a general term used to describe natural gas, crude oil, and refined products such as gasoline, heating oil, and jet fuel.\n\n#  How is gasoline created?\n\nThe process of creating gasoline begins by extracting crude oil from the ground. Crude oil is a mixture of hydrocarbons and contains many different types of molecules. The first step in creating gasoline is to separate these molecules into their individual components.\n\nThis is done through a process called fractional distillation. In fractional distillation, the crude oil is heated until it vaporizes. The vaporized oil then travels through a column where it is separated into different fractions based on their boiling points.\n\nThe lowest boiling point fractions, including methane, ethane, and propane, are collected at the bottom of the column. These fractions are known as natural gas liquids (NGLs) and are used to create gasoline and other fuels.\n\nThe next step in the process is to remove impurities from the NGLs. This is done by treating the NGLs with hydrogen gas and a catalyst. The hydrogen gas converts the impurities into water vapor and carbon dioxide gas.\n\nThe catalyst helps to break down the hydrocarbons into smaller molecules that can be more easily processed. The treated NGLs are then ready to be used to create gasoline and other fuels.\n\n#  How much oil is left in the world?\n\nOil is a finite resource, and at some point it will run out. The tricky thing is that we don't know when that will be. Estimates vary, but it's believed that we have between 50 and 150 years of oil left. That's not a lot of time, so it's important to start planning for a world without oil.\n\nThere are a lot of ways to transition away from oil. We can invest in renewable energy sources, like solar and wind power. We can also invest in electric cars and other technologies that don't rely on oil.\n\nThe sooner we start making these changes, the smoother the transition will be. And the more prepared we are for a world without oil, the better off we'll be.\n\n#  What are the environmental concerns with drilling for oil?\n\nThe process of extracting oil from the ground can be harmful to the environment. The main environmental concerns with drilling for oil are:\n\n1. Oil spills: drilling for oil can cause spills of oil and other pollutants into the environment. These spills can contaminate water supplies, damage ecosystems, and harm wildlife.\n\n2. Air pollution: drilling for oil can produce air pollution, including emissions of greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change.\n\n3. Noise pollution: drilling for oil can create noise pollution that can disturb wildlife and people’s quality of life.\n\n4. Land use: drilling for oil often requires the excavation of large areas of land, which can disrupt habitats and lead to soil erosion.\n\n5. Water use: drilling for oil can require large amounts of water, which can lead to shortages in areas where water is already scarce.\n\n#  How would we survive without oil?\n\nOil is a valuable resource that we heavily rely on in our everyday lives. It's used to make gasoline for cars, create plastics for packaging, and manufacture countless other products. So what would happen if we suddenly lost our supply of oil?\n\nThe first thing to understand is that oil is not essential for human survival. We can live without it. However, life would be much harder without it. For example, transportation would be a huge challenge. The vast majority of cars and trucks run on gasoline, which is made from oil. If we didn't have oil, we would need to come up with alternative ways to move people and goods around. This could include things like electric cars and trains, or using horses and carriages.\n\nAnother area where oil is widely used is in the production of food. Oil is used to produce fertilizers, pesticides, and other chemicals that are essential for modern agriculture. It's also used to produce plastic packaging that keeps food fresh. Without oil, we would need to find alternative ways to produce these products. This could include using more expensive organic fertilizers and biopesticides, or using metal cans instead of plastic packaging.\n\nFinally, let's consider the impact on the economy. The global economy is largely built on oil consumption. Products that use oil as a raw material are manufactured in one country and consumed in another. This creates jobs and economic activity in both countries. If we lose our dependency on oil, this could change dramatically. Countries that rely heavily on oil exports would see their economies shrink, while countries that import oil would see their prices rise dramatically.\n\nSo overall, life would be much harder without oil, but it's not impossible to survive without it. We would just need to adapt our way of life somewhat»","source":"_posts/What-is-the-difference-between-crude-oil-and-petroleum.md","raw":"---\ntitle: What is the difference between crude oil and petroleum\ndate: 2022-09-09 12:53:24\ncategories:\n- Oil and Gas Services\ntags:\n---\n\n\n#  What is the difference between crude oil and petroleum?\n\nCrude oil and petroleum are two different things, but are often confused.
